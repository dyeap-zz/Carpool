Modules under test: View Events and View Log

A. As a user, I would like a table that lists how much my friends and I
have driven, so that I can easily see the distribution of driving.

Scenario:
1. Start Driving Tracker on device
2. Log in
    - Username = "tofu"
		- Password = "tofu"
		- Press "Sign In"
3. Select "View Log"
4. The user should see a list of his friends. 
    The first column enumerates his friends. The second column contains 
		names of the current user's friends. The third column contains the
		amount of time driven each pair of friends owe to each other.

B. As a user, I would like to view a list of events I've been invited to 
and accept/decline them, so that I can chose which event to attend.

Scenario: 

1. Start Driving Tracker on device
2. Log in
    - Username = "tofu"
		- Password = "tofu"
		- Press "Sign In"
3. Select "View Events"
4. User should see his username at the top center of page and a list of 
   invitations he has received and options to accept or decline the
	 invitation.
      Two users have invited the current user to events.
	    The current user should see "toad" and "hello", who are the other two
		  users that have invited the current user to events. Next to each 
		  event organizer, there should be "accept" and "decline" buttons. 
4. Accepting/Declining invitation
		The default selection is decline.
		If the user selects accept, "accept" should be green.
		If the user selects decline, "decline" should be red.
		Otherwise, the button should be black.

Actions to stop doing:

1. We should minimize Skype calls to participate 
in meetings because the meeting doesn't progress
efficiently.
2. Give notice when one cannot attend scheduled 
Scrum meetings, so the whole team can reschedule
because we would like to prevent Skype calls.
Establish a new meeting time and give all members 
24 hour notice, so that everyone can attend the meeting.


Actions to start doing:

1. We should work on the project everyday, and 
report what we have done every other day because 
we did not get much done in the last sprint.


Actions to keep doing:
1. We should continue meeting up because we are most 
productive during those times.


Work completed/not completed:

All user stories were completed

User stories:
1. As a user, I would like a table that lists how 
much my friends and I have driven, so that I can
easily see the distribution of driving.
2. As a user, I would ike a main page to see the 
overall functionality of the application, so that
it would be intuitive to use.
3. As a user, I would like to be able to create 
an account, so that I can store my information.
